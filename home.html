					<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>Hello! I am a first-year Master's student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan School of Information
							with a planned graduation date of May 2018. Before I started school here, I taught English in Mainz, Germany as part of the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program!
						</p>
						<p>
							I have a specific interest in designs that are accessible regardless of ability, language, and device. (I am still learning!) My secondary academic interests include translation, languages, programming, psychology, biology, and statistics. Ahh, there are so many interesting things in the world! In terms of activities, I enjoy the usual - cooking, eating, petting cats (see my gallery). I don't enjoy running, but I somehow ran a half-marathon during my Fulbright year. You can see my shiny medal in the photo ;)

					<h3>Experience</h3>
					
						<h4>Media Assistant</h4>
							<h5>University of Michigan Language Resource Center | 2016 - present</h5>
							<p>
								My enthusiasm for languages and technology naturally led me to the Language Resource Center, where media and technology are used to faciliate language-learning. I assist in any way possible, but focus on the back-end and information architecture. I'm currently learning about Filemaker, but before that, I was helping plan Translate-a-thon (see Translation page!)
							</p>
						<h4>Fulbright English Teaching Assistant</h4>
							<h5 lang="de">Integrierte Gesamtschule Mainz-Bretzenheim | 2015 - 2016</h5>
							<p>
								I am so honored to have been able to spend 10 months in <span lang="de">Mainz</span>, Germany teaching English to high-school-age students. I planned lessons, led conversation groups, and discussed a lot of American culture, especially elections and gun control, which I admit were quite difficult to explain. I think the best part of this Fulbright experience though was all the connections I made outside of school. I tutored, attended as many events as I could, and even spent my last month volunteering in the kitchen of the <span lang="de">Bar Jeder Sicht</span>, a meeting place for the LGBT+ community. It was a great year, but my one regret was not volunteering earlier!
							</p>

						<h4>EECS 183 Grader</h4>
							<h5>University of Michigan Department of Computer Science and Engineering | 2015 - present</h5>
							<p>
								I look at code and dock off points if it's ugly or incoherent. It's one of my 
								favorite jobs.
							</p>

						<h4>Student Coordinator / Food Service Worker</h4>
							<h5>East Quad Dining Hall / South Quad Dining Hall | 2012 - 2015</h5>
							<p>
								This was my first job ever. I worked here all through undergrad, 
								and although some people find food service to be a degrading job, I do not. Working with 
								food is fun! And so is working with people who love food. After South Quad closed for 
								renovations, I moved to East Quad and became a student coordinator there. I trained student 
								workers, and communicated with managers to ensure the shift ran smoothly.
							</p>
						<h4>Webmaster and Historian</h4>
							<h5>German Club at the University of Michigan | 2014 - 2015</h5>
							<p>
								I"was involved in German Club since my junior year of undergrad and went on to get an executive 
								board position as Webmaster and Historian. As Historian, I took a lot of photos, and 
								as Webmaster, I posted these photos on our Facebook page and wrote weekly updates. 
							</p>

						<h4>Teacher's Assistant</h4>
							<h5>Deutsche Schule Ann Arbor | 2014</h5>
							<p>
								I helped the teacher of the Kindergarten class "teach" German to her pupils. 
								I say "teach" but it's more like "attemped to teach." Kids will learn what they want 
								to learn.
							</p>

						<h4>President, Secretary, Community Service Chair, Webmaster, Historian</h5>
							<h5>Secular Student Alliance at the University of Michigan | 2012 - 2014</p>
							<p>
								I've had a billion administrative roles as part of this organization. I've organized 
								events, sent emails, managed their Facebook, Twitter, and Blogger accounts, taken 
								photos, tabled for them, etc. All in the name of science, reason, and secular values!
							</p>

						<h4>Intern</h4>
							<h5 lang="de">Charit&eacute; Universit&auml;tsmedizin Berlin | 2014</h5>
							<p>
								As a Cultural Vistas Fellow in the Summer of 2014, I got to live and intern in Berlin 
								for free! I worked at a hospital, shadowing nutritional therapists, social workers,
								and doctors in the adiposity and gastroenterological <span lang="de">Kinderklinik</span> (children's clinic) 
								of the Charit&eacute;, as well as training personnel on SPSS and creating a database 
								for an exciting upcoming study aiming to improve fatty liver disease diagnosis.
